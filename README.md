## Hi there! I'm Max Zischka

Iâ€™m a first-year Electrical Engineering student at **McGill University**, passionate about **embedded systems, digital logic, and data structures**.

Iâ€™m currently a member of the **McGill Rocket Team (SRADIO Subteam)**, where Iâ€™m gaining experience in **C++ development** and **embedded system design** for radio communications and 
telemetry hardware.

In my personal time, I love working on electronics projects â€” from building circuits with **Arduinos** to experimenting with a **MAX10 FPGA**.

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On
- Implementing a **2048-point FFT** in both C++ (recursive) and **Verilog** for my MAX10 FPGA  
- Helping to design a **telemetry communication system** with the McGill Rocket Team (SRADIO)  
- Building a **chess-playing robot** powered by an Arduino that can move pieces and compete against a human opponent.
